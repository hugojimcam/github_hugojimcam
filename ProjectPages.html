    The project I decided to update was the final project for Professor Sal's class last quarter. I wanted to change a few things I didn't complete last quarter because I ran out of time. 
    The first thing I changed was how my portrait moves so it can wipe the screen clean. I also made the wave functions stretch the whole screen. I then deleted the circles around it because it looked cluttered. 
    I also changed the color scheme to light blue so everything is easier for the eyes. Looking at the code I wrote weeks ago, it wasn't very clear at first. 
    I had to refresh myself and was thankful for my comments and the internet for help. The main thing I wish I had done initially was to move my portrait to the center and make it move when I pressed and held a key. 
    I also wish I had made the wave functions across the whole screen because of a gap showing. I was stuck changing the color scheme because I had to figure out the correct numbers, and my code wasn't obvious. 
    I had items named red, green, and blue, which confused the editor, and I had many places to change colors.

    I wanted to try out Python for my project, but learning a new language was tough, and I wasn't creating anything I liked, so I pivoted and used Eclipse. 
    After learning more Java code in p5.js in the last quarter, I wanted to revisit Eclipse, which I started to learn about in community college. 
    I wanted to pick up an old project and decided to make a new version of a random number game I did years ago. 
    In the original game, you pick a number between 1 and 100 and guess until you get the correct number. 
    In the new version, I added multiple difficulties (easy, medium, and hard), a set number of guesses based on the level, and cool points depending on the number of guesses it takes to answer. 
    Creating files and projects in Eclipse was challenging because it was not straightforward like p5.js, because of classes, sources, and whatnot. 
    Coding in Eclipse was very satisfying. It has a cool aesthetic, and I like the console pop-up. I have no idea how you could create a visual in Eclipse, but inputting numbers and words to get a result worked great. 
    I did have to look things up when I was lost on pages like this: https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@will-ugo/random-number-generator-guessing-game-using-eclipse-ide for help. 
    Overall, it was fun and cool to explore, and I wonder what the limits of what you can make on Eclipse are.

  <h2>Final Project Proposal</h2>
  <p>
    For my project, I aim to create a music collection using the p5.js library. The user will be able to press a key, and a song will start playing, accompanied by the album cover. I have just started figuring out which songs I would like to feature and downloading them. I used this website to find the images to download for free (<a href="https://bendodson.com/projects/itunes-artwork-finder/" target="_blank">https://bendodson.com/projects/itunes-artwork-finder/</a>). Currently, the collection will feature a variety of songs I enjoy, but I may also include a theme, such as the evolution of rock music or rap. I also want some basic information to appear when the album is playing, such as the artist's name and album title. Profdfesor Stern provided me with this resource (<a href="https://musicbrainz.org/" target="_blank">https://musicbrainz.org/</a>) for my use.

Update: I decided on a theme for my project after realizing the songs I had didn't work well together outside of being great songs. The theme is hip-hop songs and their samples. I am also working on adding a visualization to the audio. I forget who, but in a past class, a CT student mentioned this to me for another project, so I am revisiting it again, and it seems more feasible now.
