    The project I decided to update was the final project for Professor Sal's class last quarter. I wanted to change a few things I didn't complete last quarter because I ran out of time. 
    The first thing I changed was how my portrait moves so it can wipe the screen clean. I also made the wave functions stretch the whole screen. I then deleted the circles around it because it looked cluttered. 
    I also changed the color scheme to light blue so everything is easier for the eyes. Looking at the code I wrote weeks ago, it wasn't very clear at first. 
    I had to refresh myself and was thankful for my comments and the internet for help. The main thing I wish I had done initially was to move my portrait to the center and make it move when I pressed and held a key. 
    I also wish I had made the wave functions across the whole screen because of a gap showing. I was stuck changing the color scheme because I had to figure out the correct numbers, and my code wasn't obvious. 
    I had items named red, green, and blue, which confused the editor, and I had many places to change colors.

    I wanted to try out Python for my project, but learning a new language was tough, and I wasn't creating anything I liked, so I pivoted and used Eclipse. 
    After learning more Java code in p5.js in the last quarter, I wanted to revisit Eclipse, which I started to learn about in community college. 
    I wanted to pick up an old project and decided to make a new version of a random number game I did years ago. 
    In the original game, you pick a number between 1 and 100 and guess until you get the correct number. 
    In the new version, I added multiple difficulties (easy, medium, and hard), a set number of guesses based on the level, and cool points depending on the number of guesses it takes to answer. 
    Creating files and projects in Eclipse was challenging because it was not straightforward like p5.js, because of classes, sources, and whatnot. 
    Coding in Eclipse was very satisfying. It has a cool aesthetic, and I like the console pop-up. I have no idea how you could create a visual in Eclipse, but inputting numbers and words to get a result worked great. 
    I did have to look things up when I was lost on pages like this: https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@will-ugo/random-number-generator-guessing-game-using-eclipse-ide for help. 
    Overall, it was fun and cool to explore, and I wonder what the limits of what you can make on Eclipse are.

  <h2>Final Project Proposal</h2>
  <p>
    For my final project, I would like to make a music archive. Last quarter, we played around with importing photo/video files into p5.js and incorporating them into our final projects.
    I would like to continue this exploration with files by making a p5.js music archive.Â  I would like to save snippets of some songs I like and the album covers of those songs in p5.js, be able to press a key, and have the sound and image pop up.
    If copyright is an issue, then I may pivot to sounds I take with my phone, but I think I can just download the songs off the internet. I also would like to make a song menu to show which buttons will play which songs.
    A rough idea of the timeline for the project is to collect the music and image files for a couple of days and then start to code the project after that. I am pretty flexible with the idea and may find something I want to add or change with the project later. 
    In terms of resources, the p5.js tutorials and some p5.js knowledge will be my main resources, with supplemental help from the internet. I will be documenting my project in GitHub. I am not sure what git comment messages are, but I will look into it.
