    The project I decided to update was the final project for Professor Sal's class last quarter. I wanted to change a few things I didn't complete last quarter because I ran out of time.

    I wanted to try out Python for my project, but learning a new language was tough, and I wasn't creating anything I liked, so I pivoted and used Eclipse. 
    After learning more Java code in p5.js in the last quarter, I wanted to revisit Eclipse, which I started to learn about in community college. 
    I wanted to pick up an old project and decided to make a new version of a random number game I did years ago. 
    In the original game, you pick a number between 1 and 100 and guess until you get the correct number. 
    In the new version, I added multiple difficulties (easy, medium, and hard), a set number of guesses based on the level, and cool points depending on the number of guesses it takes to answer. 
    Creating files and projects in Eclipse was challenging because it was not straightforward like p5.js, because of classes, sources, and whatnot. 
    Coding in Eclipse was very satisfying. It has a cool aesthetic, and I like the console pop-up. I have no idea how you could create a visual in Eclipse, but inputting numbers and words to get a result worked great. 
    I did have to look things up when I was lost on pages like this: https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@will-ugo/random-number-generator-guessing-game-using-eclipse-ide for help. 
    Overall, it was fun and cool to explore, and I wonder what the limits of what you can make on Eclipse are.
