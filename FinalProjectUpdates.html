    <strong>Offramp 1:</strong> For my project, I aim to create a music collection using the p5.js library. The user will be able to press a key, and a song will start playing, accompanied by the album cover. I have just started figuring out which songs I would like to feature and downloading them. I used this website to find the images to download for free (<a href="https://bendodson.com/projects/itunes-artwork-finder/" target="_blank">https://bendodson.com/projects/itunes-artwork-finder/</a>). Currently, the collection will feature a variety of songs I enjoy, but I may also include a theme, such as the evolution of rock music or rap. I also want some basic information to appear when the album is playing, such as the artist's name and album title. Professor Stern provided me with this resource (<a href="https://musicbrainz.org/" target="_blank">https://musicbrainz.org/</a>) for my use.

    Update: I decided on a theme for my project after realizing the songs I had didn't work well together outside of being great songs. The theme is hip-hop songs and their samples. I am also working on adding a visualization to the audio. I forget who, but in a past class, a CT student mentioned this to me for another project, so I am looking at it again, and it seems more doable now.

    <strong>Offramp 2 (makeup for technics and time):</strong> I was working on the coding for my final project and reached a point where I felt I could add the audio, but I couldn't download the music from Spotify due to a nationwide issue with the service. I thought it was because the software I downloaded to remove music from Spotify messed up my computer. I almost pivoted to working on a backup project for the final, but through Reddit, I found this website:Â https://cnvmp3.com/v25, which converts YouTube videos to MP3. Other than that, the project has been moving along. There has been a lot of downloading and converting so far, and I've had to obtain files that are under the file size limit for p5.js. There are many things I don't know how to do, so I am trying to learn what I can.  

    <br><br>
    Update: I have changed the music in the collection multiple times and eventually started over, creating a theme. The theme for the collection is Hip-Hop songs and their samples. My favorite thing about music is that it inspires and influences other music through sampling. I will showcase the use of samples in my collection, allowing you to hear the influence directly.

  Documentation: 

For my final project, I created a collection of hip-hop songs and their samples. The coding language I had the most knowledge of was p5.js due to my previous creative coding class, so I wanted to use it for my final project. I had some knowledge required for this project, such as using audio files, mapping keys, creating loops, and creating indexes, among other skills. It would be a good opportunity to push myself and learn more. I linked the resources I used below to fill in the gaps. They range from projects I found through the web and Reddit to a project from last quarter. I started using Spotify and attempted to download the audio files using a converter, but Spotify was down. I almost changed my project entirely, but through some research, I realized I could use YouTube and another converter instead. This process was the most tedious because I had to find videos that were under 4 minutes long and had no movement to keep the file size under 5 MB so they would load into p5.js. On a positive note, this saved me from having to download the images and audio files again, as I could download a video file that contains both. I had changed the songs many times, so the audio and image files I had initially used didn't hold much significance. I spent time learning what I could implement to make the code more efficient. I tried some things that didn't work, such as playing the videos simultaneously and having two videos side by side. It was too complicated for me, but something I could see myself adding in the future. It was easy to get sidetracked and start something but run into a wall and have to turn back. To compensate for my initial idea of using keys to overlap the songs, I created a visualizer with assistance from other projects I found and the p5.js libraries. I added a doodle I made in Procreate as the background image for the title page, ensured all the formatting looked okay, and then finished my project.
