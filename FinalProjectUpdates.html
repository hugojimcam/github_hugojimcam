    <strong>Offramp 1:</strong> For my project, I aim to create a music collection using the p5.js library. The user will be able to press a key, and a song will start playing, accompanied by the album art and song info.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Update:</strong><br>
    I decided on a theme for my project after realizing the songs I had didn't work well together outside of being great songs. The theme is hip-hop songs and their samples. I am also working on adding more visualizations.

    <strong>Offramp 2 (makeup for technics and time):</strong> I was working on the coding for my final project and reached a point where I felt I could add the audio, but I couldn't download the music files due to copyright issues, so I used short samples instead.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Update:</strong><br>
    I have changed the music in the collection multiple times and eventually started over, creating a theme. The theme for the collection is Hip-Hop songs and their samples. My favorite thing so far is seeing the connection between different songs and how samples are used creatively.
