  <h2>Final Project Updates</h2>
  <p>
    For my project, I aim to create a music collection using the p5.js library. The user will be able to press a key, and a song will start playing, accompanied by the album cover. I have just started figuring out which songs I would like to feature and downloading them. I used this website to find the images to download for free (https://bendodson.com/projects/itunes-artwork-finder/). Currently, the collection will feature a variety of songs I enjoy, but I may also include a theme, such as the evolution of rock music or rap. I also want some basic information to appear when the album is playing, such as the artist's name and album title. The professor provided me with this resource to use (https://musicbrainz.org/) for that purpose.
