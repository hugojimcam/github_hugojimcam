    <strong>Offramp 1:</strong> For my project, I aim to create a music collection using the p5.js library. The user will be able to press a key, and a song will start playing, accompanied by the album cover. I have just started figuring out which songs I would like to feature and downloading them. I used this website to find the images to download for free (<a href="https://bendodson.com/projects/itunes-artwork-finder/" target="_blank">https://bendodson.com/projects/itunes-artwork-finder/</a>). Currently, the collection will feature a variety of songs I enjoy, but I may also include a theme, such as the evolution of rock music or rap. I also want some basic information to appear when the album is playing, such as the artist's name and album title. Professor Stern provided me with this resource (<a href="https://musicbrainz.org/" target="_blank">https://musicbrainz.org/</a>) for my use.

    Update: I decided on a theme for my project after realizing the songs I had didn't work well together outside of being great songs. The theme is hip-hop songs and their samples. I am also working on adding a visualization to the audio. I forget who, but in a past class, a CT student mentioned this to me for another project, so I am looking at it again, and it seems more doable now.

    <strong>Offramp 2 (makeup for technics and time):</strong> I was working on the coding for my final project and reached a point where I felt I could add the audio, but I couldn't download the music from Spotify due to a nationwide issue with the service. I thought it was because the software I downloaded to remove music from Spotify messed up my computer. I almost pivoted to working on a backup project for the final, but through Reddit, I found this website:Â https://cnvmp3.com/v25, which converts YouTube videos to MP3. Other than that, the project has been moving along. There has been a lot of downloading and converting so far, and I've had to obtain files that are under the file size limit for p5.js. There are many things I don't know how to do, so I am trying to learn what I can.  

    <br><br>
    Update: I have changed the music in the collection multiple times and eventually started over, creating a theme. The theme for the collection is Hip-Hop songs and their samples. My favorite thing about music is that it inspires and influences other music through sampling. I will showcase the use of samples in my collection, allowing you to hear the influence directly.
