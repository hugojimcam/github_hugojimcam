  <h2>Final Project Updates</h2>
  <p>
    Updates: 
    
    Offramp 1: For my project, I aim to create a music collection using the p5.js library. The user will be able to press a key, and a song will start playing, accompanied by the album cover. I have just started figuring out which songs I would like to feature and downloading them. I used this website to find the images to download for free (https://bendodson.com/projects/itunes-artwork-finder/). Currently, the collection will feature a variety of songs I enjoy, but I may also include a theme, such as the evolution of rock music or rap. I also want some basic information to appear when the album is playing, such as the artist's name and album title. The professor provided me with this resource to use (https://musicbrainz.org/) for that purpose.     

    Offramp 2 (makeup for technics and time): I was working on the coding for my final project and reached a point where I felt I could add the audio, but I couldn't download the music from Spotify due to a nationwide issue with the service. I thought it was because of the software I downloaded to take music off Spotify messed up my computer. I almost pivoted to working on a backup project for the final but through reddit figured found this website: https://cnvmp3.com/v25 which converts yooutube videos to mp3. Other than that, it is going well. There has been a lot of downloading and converting so far, and I've had to obtain files that are under the file size limit for p5.js.
