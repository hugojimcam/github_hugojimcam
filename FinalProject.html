  <h2>Final Project Proposal</h2>
  <p>
    For my final project, I would like to make a music archive. Last quarter, we played around with importing photo/video files into p5.js and incorporating them into our final projects. I would like to continue this exploration with files by making a p5.js music archive.  I would like to save snippets of some songs I like and the album covers of those songs in p5.js, be able to press a key, and have the sound and image pop up. If copyright is an issue, then I may pivot to sounds I take with my phone, but I think I can just download the songs off the internet. I also would like to make a song menu to show which buttons will play which songs. A rough idea of the timeline for the project is to collect the music and image files for a couple of days and then start to code the project after that. I am pretty flexible with the idea and may find something I want to add or change with the project later. In terms of resources, the p5.js tutorials and some p5.js knowledge will be my main resources, with supplemental help from the internet. I will be documenting my project in GitHub. I am not sure what git comment messages are, but I will look into it.
